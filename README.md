# NSSI_hairProteomics

Public repository does not contain the data folder, which is necessary to reproduce the analyses.
Please contact us for data access.

Analyses were conducted in R version 4.2.1. Version-controlled packages are provided with the renv package.  

To run the scripts:  
- Open the R project file **"NSSI_hairProteomics"**  
- Install and load the package **"renv"** by typing:  
  ```r
  install.packages("renv")
  library("renv")
  renv::restore()
  ```

The two R scripts on the top folder level are the main analysis scripts to run.
